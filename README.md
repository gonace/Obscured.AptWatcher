Obscured.AptWatcher is a simple web-app that helps you keep track of OS updates as well as keeping you up to date with actions to keep your servers updated and secure.

## How it works


#### Structure
One line is interpreted as one service
```
{
  "name": "service_name",
  "version_installed": "1.0.0",
  "version_available": "1.0.1"
}
```
##### Example Input
```
{"name":"service_a","version_installed":"1.0.0","version_available":"1.0.1"}
{"name":"service_b","version_installed":"1.0.0","version_available":"1.0.1"}
{"name":"service_c","version_installed":"1.0.0","version_available":"1.0.1"}
```



If any packages are in that payload that were not previously sent, a message is sent via a Slack incoming webhook with that list of new
packages.

## Installation
The easiest way to get going is deploying to Heroku:

Otherwise, you can bundle, create your database, migrate, and run:

```
$ bundle
```
